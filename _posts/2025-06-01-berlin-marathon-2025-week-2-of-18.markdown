## Thoughts

This week was a treat for me because I look forward to long runs more than tempo and interval runs. After finishing 80 km last week without any residual discomfort and pain on my legs, I decided to continue my practice of doing 10 km recovery runs on rest days.

The general aerobic days were exciting as I had the freedom within my Zone 2 ranges and I was getting the hang on running slower to keep from running too fast. I tested my used pair of Puma MagMax on recovery days and unfortunately they weren’t reactive to the point of discomfort if I went beyond one hour of running with them. It was disappointing and I wish I bought a new pair instead because the glowing reviews online mentioned about their durability that gave me confidence in purchasing a secondhand pair.

### Sunday

I had a great time executing this long run especially with my target marathon pace of 5:30/km. I wore my Asics Superblast 2s just to be sure and had my usual gummy bears and chewable energy gels.

I went over my target pace unfortunately with an average of 5:18/km but it was because I already was cruising without too much effort and exhaustion. I just kept running and only slowed down if I went faster than 5:10/km which is too much. 

Overall this was the perfect balance of length and target intensity based on my current fitness. I didn’t have trouble to mentally motivate myself to go further because my route was filled with lots of sights and other runners but if it was the 18/70 plan of 25.7 km I believe I would have struggled.

Afterwards, as always, I did foam roller massages on my legs and I spent the day checking my lower body’s healing because of going over my target MP and pray I will not regret it next week.
