## Thoughts

I wasn’t fully recovered on Tuesday morning so I kept my intensity to the lower half of my Zone 2 for the run. I kept running on Wednesday morning in spite of my left shin feeling slightly painful when running (3/10) but it was raining so I didn’t want to miss it.

I was supposed to do 16 km on Thursday morning but after walking around after waking up, I still felt a bit of pain (2/10) including my left posterior tendon so I decided that more days of running for the rest of the week is better than one day of being stubborn. Looking back I shouldn’t have ran with my worn out Puma DN3s during last week’s mid-week long run because I wouldn’t be dealing with the leftover fatigue this week.

By Friday and Saturday, the left shin pain was gone but I made sure to run at the lower of my Z2 ranges to help my legs adapt slowly. I’m thankful for this mini-taper week because I will probably miss more workouts if it was a regular one. 

I also realised that the left shin pain was caused by overstriding last Monday wherein I engaged my shins too much. I’m never going to do that again!

This morning was a wonderful sunny medium-long run. I used my brand new Puma DN3s and ran using a metronome app that I gradually increased from 175 to 180 steps per minute during the main block of my workout. The cadence practice went well because I learned that I can go slow or fast with the same cadence and it was just a matter of effort which was eye-opening. I didn't check my heart rate at all after the warm-up block because my goal was to hit the cadences and paces needed.

By kilometer 19 or 20, I felt the DN3s hit the pavement harder each step and I wish I wore more cushioned shoes. This is a final personal reminder to not use them beyond half-marathon distances because they are not built for that. Regardless since it wasn’t beyond 25 km, my legs and feet weren’t damaged too much and thankful for another finished week despite the missed workout.
