## Thoughts

### Monday

Before I slept last night, I already anticipated that waking up will be difficult this morning. I was correct - my entire body felt heavy and I had a slight headache. I am thankful that there’s no run scheduled today because I am no capable of doing even a recovery run and I will just cancel it. I slept for another 30 minutes because there’s no rush and I only had home exercises to do.

The yoga and mobility workouts were fine aside from my slightly rigid joints and muscles. It was evident during each position but that’s expected and I was still able to execute all of them. Additionally there were no discomfort on my legs especially the ankles which I am thankful for.

I let myself do more repetitions during the core drills because I only wanted to do one set and this would be a good compromise instead of two. It was still easy so I think I should move on to the advanced version in the Advanced Marathoning book next week to check.

### Tuesday

Unfortunately I woke up slightly weak, coming from yesterday’s lingering feverish feeling all day. I made a difficult decision to cancel today’s VO₂max repeats and replace it with a recovery run. I didn’t feel confident because of the fever and some level of residual fatigue was still present; fortunately I didn’t feel any discomfort or soreness on my ankles and legs because these will make it harder for me.

I took a paracetamol tablet before running because it was that terrible but I had a motivation in the form of my new pair of Salomon Aero Glide 3 GRVLs to test for the first time. This is a possible long run substitute to my Saucony Triumph 22s so I made sure to take note of everything while running.

The run was okay for what it is and I believe that I made the correct decision to take it easy today. I need this entire day to fully recover from last weekend because yesterday wasn’t enough. I hope I will be back to do another quality run tomorrow morning.

**Salomon Aero Glide 3 GRVL**

It was very light and springy for daily trainer-priced shoes! The warm-up skips were fun to do and I really felt the feedback immediately. I didn’t feel its weight hinder each step but I can say that it is less clunky than my pair of Asics Superblast 2. 

I saw comments online that it runs long and I disagree. It is a bit narrow on the toe box which was evident when I wore my socks today. Unfortunately it was the thinnest one I have so I will do a runner’s knot for next run and maybe this will help push my feet further so my toes have more room. Regardless I didn’t have my usual pink toe issues in other shoes with these during the first run.

I actually used it last Saturday for a walk and the most prominent thing I noticed was that the outer left and right of the left and right shoes respectively have thicker foam which made me feel like both pinky toes were raised a bit compared to the rest. I am not well-versed with shoe stability technology but I think this could be one of such features because it helped me push more from my “natural” big toe.

The grip from the GRVL was nice but still doesn’t compete with Puma’s but better than Asics’ current outsoles. I only tried it in dry trails this morning and it performed well on annoying cobblestones of varying sizes. I was able to run with a faster cadence of 175 spm without much difficulty because of its lightness and I will try again to increase it to upper 180s on my long runs to further verify if it will perform great.

I have some level of expectations in terms of bounciness and the amount of foam on the forefoot and mid-foot and the shoes didn’t fulfill much of both today. Since this is a first try, I will take note of them but will reserve my judgement after a long run of more than 90 minutes. I think that is a better environment to test them further. Although I liked the firmness of the foam and I believe I can cruise in these easily in paces of up to 5:30/km. I am hoping they can handle 180 spm+ cadence and at most 5:00/km so I have two long runs this week to check. 

Overall they’re light, reliable and look good for me. I like minimal monochromatic running shoes and these are perfect because they almost look unbranded which I prefer for a lot of my clothes. I have to try them for a long run to further get to know them better and I think we will have a good time together.

### Wednesday

**Morning session**

Today’s long run went well! I felt good when I woke up and definitely better than the last two mornings. 

It was an important run because I had to take notes of how the AG3 GRVLs will perform during the long run. The most significant details is if it will start hurting at 16 km or so similar to my Puma Deviate NITRO 3s. 

The warm-up was terrible! The shoes felt dead despite it being super light and springy on my feet. I was already having doubts if I wasted my money and I concluded that these are not for slow paces at 6:30/km or slower. They are just not protective similar to Saucony Triumph 22 and SB2s.

The following is the workout I did:

1. 1.61 km warm-up @ Zone 1
2. 3.62 km @ 6:08-6:24/km (20% less than my target MP)
3. 10.86 km @ 5:52-6:08/km (10% less than my target MP)

Since this was a long run, I had to use my metronome. The progression was 180 spm for the second block followed by 182 spm and 184 spm for the last block after each five kilometers. 

I remember having to put more effort in keeping the minimum of 6:24/km pace at first but was able to maintain it with the help of the target 180 spm. Eventually the shoes shined at 182 spm for some reason! Each of my mid-foot strikes were smooth and light though I had to exert some effort to keep up with the paces because the foam and rubber outsole can only respond back with this level of daily trainer performance. 

Regardless the main block was super fun and it happens rarely but I found myself surprised that I already reached 16 km! There were no pains on my toes, ankles and shins despite this being a first long run test of new shoes! My route had two kilometers left so I completed them and still after 18 km I felt great. My legs had some tiredness on then but nothing was damaged though they will not compare to the freshness after long runs with SB2s.

I am both impressed and appreciative that I didn’t waste my money. I bought these as easy long run shoes and they performed as I expected. I am going to run with them again on Friday and I am excited because I will spend more time with them again on higher cadences.

**Evening session**

I usually leave eight hours of rest between two workouts in a hard day based from common suggestions online. I decided to try the “Advanced Core Strength Session” from the book since I’ve been doing the basic version for weeks. 

I did one set of the advanced core, one set of the basic core and one set of the same strength workouts. For the last one I used weights and I like the extra level of difficulty during the rows, tricep press and lunges (I held a barbell on each hand).

### Thursday

I woke up terrible this morning because my upper body felt so heavy! I realised this was caused by the upgraded weights I incorporated last night during the strength sessions. 

The recovery run was fine with the Saucony Triumph 22s. They were boring and did what they had to do - to protect my feet and to keep me running slow. It was a stark contrast from the light and springy AG3s from the past two days but the T22s are definitely better when we needed extra protection while running.

### Friday

I have learned to love and look forward to mid-week long runs of the Advanced Marathoning plan and today was not an exception. I was extra excited because I wanted to try if the magic of the AG3 GRVLs will be consistent from Wednesday’s.

I use the same workout pattern for all my long runs and for today it is the following:

1. 1.61 km warm-up @ Zone 1
2. 4.43 km @ 6:08-6:24/km (20% less than my target MP)
3. 13.28 km @ 5:52-6:08/km (10% less than my target MP)

Similar to what I observed on the first two runs this week with the shoes, they were terrible at lower cadences (< 180 spm) and to make it fun during the warm-up I increased it a bit.

I had a hard time starting the second block as I picked up the cadence to 180 spm while trying to stay within the lower target of 6:24/km. I eventually got the rhythm but in times like this I think I should increase the warm-up distance.

Honestly both the lightness and springiness of the shoes that I experienced earlier this week were not obvious today even during my dynamic stretches and skips. I wore heavier Triumph 22s yesterday so I assumed there should be a more pronounced difference on my feet but there was nothing special in simpler words. I don’t know if I’m nitpicking and having high expectations again but I’m glad I was proven wrong again today.

| Distance from start | Cadence |
| --- | --- |
| 1.61 km | 180 spm |
| 6.04 km ( 13 km left) | 182 spm |
| 9.31 km (10 km left) | 184 spm |
| 12.31 km (7 km left) | 186 spm |
| 15.31 km (4 km left) | 188 spm |

It’s not a long run without my trusted metronome app and I decided to let the final four kilometers reach 188 spm. I divided the main block into four sub-sections of 3-4 km each that perfectly allowed me to go from 182 to 188 spm.

The run became lively when I hit the 184 spm mark. Before I was still trying to keep my pace within the ranges with some level of effort but this time, the cadence was carrying me to the faster paces easier. I checked my feet again for any form of discomfort and fortunately there were none. My forefoot was enjoyable compared to mid-foot strikes because of the smoother transition but both were efficient regardless.

The final ten kilometers between 186 and 188 spm went like a breeze. Usually my ankles and shins would hurt halfway through but this time there were still none. There’s the occasional tiredness but I just take a sip from my homemade gel and it will be gone in a few minutes. I believe that I have practiced enough to the point where these two cadences do not feel like I am sprinting and getting tired quick (but my heart rate was still within Zone 3). They now feel the same way effort-wise as 180-184 spm and my legs are used to them completely. 

By the last kilometer, since it ends at 19.31 km, I rounded it up to 20 like always. I did a final body check and I was confident that I can continue another five or ten kilometers with the same intensity (I was running at an average of 5:45/km by this time) while my legs and feet were still on board. I would appreciate more cushioning but for now the extra rubber on the outsole serves kind of the same purpose.

### Saturday

It was fine but the Triumph 22s weren’t fun anymore even after changing the insoles. I know I claimed they became lively and softer a few runs ago but I didn’t experience that anymore. It has been used for 200 km and unfortunately there were more terrible days compared to the good ones. I kept it slow at under 6:40/km but the shoes need more cushioning. I can forgive the lack of responsiveness but my feet definitely suffered with the weight and overall below average foams. I might use the SB2s for the coming recovery days instead because that’s the only pair I have that would work for short slow runs.

### Sunday

**Before the run**

To start the day, I woke up with my left ankle in a bit of discomfort. I believe this was a leftover from last Friday’s long run and could have been made worse by yesterday’s with Triumph 22 (we are not on good terms right now so I will blame it). My watch also stated that I only slept for five hours last night. Everything will be all right I told myself.

As usual I had one oatmeal bar, one banana and one loperamide tablet washed down with water before putting on my sunblock and petroleum jelly and getting dressed. I also took one paracetamol just in case to help alleviate any headache because I only slept for five hours last night.

I also decided to give my Puma Deviate NITRO Elite 3s another chance today with the caveat that I will make sure to run with higher cadence (180 spm and higher). Before I will start to feel discomfort on my forefeet with my natural cadence at around 16-18 km consistently. After last week’s revelation that I feel great during and after runs with the higher cadence of the AG3 GRVL, I wanted to check if this will carry over the more advanced shoes. I know that I am taking a risk using them compared to my trusted SB2s but I remember my last 10 km tune-up race last week that had a total of 20 km including the warm-up and cool down sessions where I didn’t feel any pain after. This run and my cadence theory were enough to make me take the risk.

Lastly I brought two flasks with the other one a leftover from the previous two long runs and barely filled at around 1/4 with gel. Additionally I got two packs of gummy bears as usual in case I get sick of the gels.

**During the run**

I immediately started the WU at sort of following my 180 spm setting in the metronome app. I wasn’t impatient but I was checking if there were any discomfort that I should take note of and luckily nothing notable happened. This continued to the second block and of course it started a bit rough on the first kilometer because I had to be within the pace range and by this time I set the cadence to 182 spm. Afterwards I got the hang of the slight change in intensity and was able to cruise to the end. Usually I would divide this into two with the latter having another increase in cadence but I didn’t because it will push my planned limit to 192 spm which was too much for today. 

As for nutrition I kept one giant sip of my gels after every two to two and a half kilometers. 

1. 1.61 km warm-up @ Zone 1
2. 4.83 km @ 5:52-6:24/km (10%-20% less than my target MP)
3. 22.53 km @ 5:20/km (current MP target)

For today I chose to do it in Tempelhofer Feld because of the reliable number of drinking fountains and generous amount of toilets in case of emergencies. Of course I remember that I tend to struggle mentally on the last 1/3 of my long runs there because of the repetitiveness (I’ve been running there for three years and have probably ran most of the accessible paths at least once!) and the windy parts that slow you down. Regardless I know that it will only make me wiser for race day whatever challenge I face there mentally.

On the way to the old airport, there is a giant uphill in Neukölln that coincides with the start of the main block that I want to thank because I was able to get into the rhythm of the 184 spm cadence and increase my speed a bit to be near 5:20/km. I gave myself grace this time because 5:52/km to 5:20/km is a giant increase in pace and allowed the first few kilometers to let my legs get used to it. Through the years I managed to change my hatred of uphills into what I can use to my advantage with proper posture and breathing. Too bad I am terrible with downhills because I am always afraid of tripping. That’s one thing I need to get over in the future.

I know I was supposed to abide by my newly-chosen MP but after two kilometers of the main block I found that I can push it a bit between 5:05-5:10/km. I just made a note to not go faster than 5:00/km because that’s not part of the plan today. I was wrong later.

By this time I divided the 22 km block into four sections by increasing cadence. The first three five kilometers with be from 184 to 188 spm and to make it exciting the remaining seven kilometers will be 190 spm. It was cool challenge that I was willing to put myself in.

Near the entrance of the airport I started using my full flask now and I realised that it was spilling from the drinking spout! I also felt some gel left on my tights. It was unfortunate and the only thing on my mind was to reach the second fountain to was my hands and the flask because it was sticky! 

When I reached the fountain, I had another hiccup because after washing and refilling my flask, I realised that I forgot to stop my watch so there’s this 5:28 kilometer lap on my record. It’s not a big deal so I continued running. Unfortunately as soon as I sped up, the flask kept spilling the water! There’s something wrong with the spout and I made a note to fix it later. I was a bit worried because I was only halfway and two packs of gummy bears are not enough if this flask becomes empty.  

After I settled from all the flask drama, I suddenly felt a rush of renewed energy. I was truly surprised because I did stop at the fountain (but still moving my feet in position) and that usually means I interrupted my momentum from before. For some reason my watch told me I was running at around 4:30/km and I had to slow down because that will be too much effort. 

Amidst all of these I did another body check and it was halfway at around 15-16km. I was happy because don’t feel any discomfort on my feet especially the left ankle that was sore when I woke up. I have finally surpassed the complaints I used to have with my DNE3s and the relief kept me going.

| Distance from start | Distance left | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 km | 29 km | 180 spm |
| 1.61 km | 27 km | 182 spm |
| 6.44 km | 22 km | 184 spm |
| 11.44 | 17 km | 186 spm |
| 16.44 | 12 km | 188 spm |
| 21.44 | 7 km | 190 spm |

The last 12 km was going well and became more lively when I hit the 190 spm. I thought I would my legs will eventually hit their limit in terms of the fast turnover because even though the cadence is not new to me (I am able to reach it during tempo runs when I go all-out effort), this is the first time I have to consciously maintain it. Fortunately all my feet did was go faster and I appreciated the DNE3s more and more. It was the best part of today’s run because I was in that zone of running fast but still holding back to keep some energy in the tank for the remainder of the workout. I want to experience this again and hopefully during the race.

On the other hand, at around the start of the last seven kilometers, I felt a certain muscle at the back of my right thigh tighten immediately and it was consistent until the end. It wasn’t too uncomfortable to even consider stopping so I continued and I eventually forgot about it until I finished. Although the discomfort become more prominent while doing my cool down walk where it slightly affected how I walked that I was nearly limping to keep from triggering it. I now have a new learning of what I am lacking in terms of strengthening specific parts of my legs and I am thankful that it wasn’t too bad while running. It was really balanced today with these extremes in both positive and negative experiences that will both help me be a better runner.

I ate what I said earlier to not go under 5:00/km because starting at 15 kilometers I was already at around 4:55/km. I was still comfortable and nothing was alarming me to stop - breathing, my ankles, shins, my arms, nothing! This is why I decided to go a bit faster on the last two kilometers to test my capacity because I still felt great overall with the high cadence and the support of the shoes. By this time I was around 4:50/km and I let go, just running within the cadence to whatever faster pace it will take me but not too fast. I made sure I was still 30 seconds slower than my half-marathon pace. 4:35/km for the last kilometer while still holding back is not bad. I remember I felt I could go on to complete a marathon only if I still had another full flask of gel that’s not leaking.

**After the run**

I am extremely proud and beyond satisfied with my performance during and the results today! The main block of 22.61 km had an average pace of 4:59/km (could have been lower if I didn’t have the stop watch mishap midway but I have no regrets) which is six seconds faster per lap compared to my last MP long run last month.

I am still on the fence if I will update my target MP from 5:20/km to 5:10/km this coming week. My left ankle felt so sore today (aside from the left shin and the back muscle on my right thigh) and it’s the only thing that’s keeping my confidence to do the update. I will check tomorrow morning and maybe Tuesday’s to see if it subsides. The VO2Max on Tuesday is also in consideration if I will just change it to a recovery run.

| Date | Expected MP | Actual MP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-06-22 | 5:30/km | 5:10/km |
| 2025-07-20 | 5:20/km | 5:05/km |
| 2025-08-17 | 5:20/km | 4:59/km |

Lastly my evening core and strength workouts are cancelled today because of the aforementioned ankle and thigh sores. I don’t want to aggravate them further with additional effort and I can do them on another day this coming week.

### Overall

My personal revelation in the past four weeks of practicing higher cadence (180 spm+) is that I now enjoy my easy/slow and progressive MP long runs better in the shoes I have (DNE3, AG3 GRVL), not thrashed and still have fresh legs after. I used to hate the DNE3s a lot with my “natural” cadence of around 170-175 spm even when I try to go fast (tempo runs and races not included) and now the difference is night and day! I am planning to apply this to my SB2s and the regular Deviate NITRO 3 if both will have the same effect especially the latter which I give up on an upper limit of 16 km.

Unfortunately I didn’t do a lot of workouts this week but I hope to make up for them next week. It’s hard to balance strengthening to keep me from injuries while cancelling them to not irritate my lower body with lingering sores and in the end I want to run more so I pick the latter for more recovery. They can be rescheduled on another quality day.
