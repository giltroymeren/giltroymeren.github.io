## Thoughts

I switched to 18/63 two weeks ago from 18/55 after maintaining an average of 90 km weekly in its first three weeks without any injury or decline in performance during quality runs. 

This fifth week I had three quality runs: a tempo and two long runs and I was relieved to finish the tempo immediately because it is usually the one I dread. After three LT workouts I think I’m starting to learn how to find that place to maintain my pace and keep myself in check in case I break down in form or slow down. It was successful and I am proud of the 4:18/km average. 

The GA immediately after the tempo day scared me a bit because I was used to a recovery day after but it went well - no ankle and shin pains up to Friday. 

Unfortunately I wore my nearly dead Puma Deviate NITRO 3s (~472mi/760 km) for the medium-long run and they caused a bit of shin pain after the 16 km mark which carried on up to Sunday morning. I did some ankle drills and massages on Saturday to help mitigate the pain because I didn’t want to skip a marathon pace run. I think it helped a bit because I was able to finish the long run without any major pains. The MP block went smoothly during my route because it was both sunny and windy.
