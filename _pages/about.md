I am a frontend web developer at [Talon.One GmbH](https://www.talon.one/about-us). I work in a team responsible for the development of user interface design and interactions for the T1 ecosystem.

This site mainly serves as a programming journal to share interesting bits from my projects, bugs encountered during work and new information taken from my exploration of new web technologies.

When I am not programming I spend time as a casual illustrator (under the name [*somelitrato*](https://somelitrato.tumblr.com/)) and currently studying traditional sketching and painting.
