I am a front-end web developer at the [Nokia Technology Center Philippines](https://www.linkedin.com/company/networklabs-inc-a-joint-venture-of-nokia-siemens-networks-). I work in a team responsible for design, development and maintenance of user interfaces for cellular site software.

This site mainly serves as a programming journal to share interesting bits from my projects, bugs encountered during work and new information taken from my exploration of new web technologies.

When I am not programming I spend time as a casual illustrator (under the name [*somelitrato*](https://somelitrato.tumblr.com/)) and currently studying traditional sketching, watercolor and acrylic painting.
